## 📑 Contents

### 🔹 Core Notebooks (Learning Path)

1. **Introduction** – What is NumPy & why use it?
2. **Array Creation** – Creating arrays with lists, ranges, and functions.
3. **Array Attributes & Indexing** – Shape, size, slicing, and indexing.
4. **Array Operations** – Arithmetic, comparison, logical operations.
5. **Array Manipulation** – Reshaping, stacking, splitting.
6. **Mathematical Functions** – Universal functions (`ufuncs`).
7. **Random Module** – Random numbers, distributions, reproducibility.
8. **Statistics & Linear Algebra** – Mean, variance, eigenvalues, dot products.

---

### 🔹 Exercises

* `array_exercises.ipynb` – Practice array creation & indexing.
* `matrix_exercises.ipynb` – Matrix math, transpose, inverses.
